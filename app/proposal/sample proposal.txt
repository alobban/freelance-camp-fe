Hi Customer Name,

It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review project requirements, I believe it is a great fit for the types of applications that I build out. Please feel free to check out some of my projects here.

To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing Ruby on Rails, Angular, and postgreSQL, and a number of other tools to ensure that the project follows industry wide best practices.

Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating that we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and sending you a project update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the development as it takes place.

To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it will take 80 hours in development time to complete. The project should take 9 weeks to complete and with my hourly rate of 120/hour, the estimated total will be $9,600.

The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts.

I am excited to be working with you and build out this project.
